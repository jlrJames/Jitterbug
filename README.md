## Workflow Management
### Assests, Scenes, & Scripts Folders
* Store each respective resource in the correct folder for better mangement
* Scripts automatically refactor if you move the script to the folder after development
### Scene Modularity and Git
* Build scenes up as modular as possible. This will help with avoiding merge conflicts
* Seperate scenes for player, enemy1, player_bullet, etc. 
* When building a conglomerate scene (i.e. Level 1), might be worth letting others know you're working on it to avoid merge conflcts. 
* Always pull before starting; Always push when finish or take a break; Commit often
